Working:-
we use python language and OpenCV library for this project. In this code, we use face cascade and eye cascade classifiers to detect face and eyes. using VideoCapture method of opencv we enable systems camera. Using a loop we continuously add a new frame to frame_variable. and using cvtColor method of opencv we concert color image to black and white image because face and eye cascade works on grayscale image. after getting face coordinates we find eyes coordinates and after finding eye coordinates we draw a rectangular to these coordinates. Using a conditional statement if eyes are closed for more than 20 frames than using putText method of opencv we print "Drowsiness Alert!" on our video screen. and beep sound produced by winsound library. And if the user press "ESC" then this video stopped. In the end, we release VideoCapture and destroyed all windows.
